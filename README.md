# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis was to understand the ride-sharing demand and data in different city types (Urban, Suburban, Rural). We performed comparartive analysis based on three major areas: the average fare per driver in each city type, the average fare per driver in each city type, and finally the market share of rides per city type. 

## Results
We performed comparative analysis between the city types based on the following: total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fares per city type. 
### Pyber Data Summary

We created a new dataframe containing the total rides, total drivers, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver for each city type. Based on our results we see that the total number of fares, drivers, and rides are much higher in urban city types than in the other city types. Rural cities unsurprisingly have the least amount of rides, drivers, and fares. This should remain true in most cities as urban areas have a higher population while rural areas will have less demand in general. However, as we move into the averages for fares per ride and fares per driver, we notice that areas with less population and demand have a higher price per ride/driver. While urban areas average out to around $24.5 and $16.5 per ride and driver respectively, we notice that in rural areas these numbers jump up to $34.6 and $55.4. This may be a result of there being less drivers in rural areas and therefore the inelastic demands in rural areas causes each fare to have a higher price.
