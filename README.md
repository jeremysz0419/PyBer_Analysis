# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis was to understand the ride-sharing demand and data in different city types (Urban, Suburban, Rural). We performed comparartive analysis based on three major areas: the average fare per driver in each city type, the average fare per driver in each city type, and finally the market share of rides per city type. 

## Results
We performed comparative analysis between the city types based on the following: total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fares per city type. 
### Pyber Data Summary

As we see in our pie charts representing our analysis on total rides and total drivers by city type, urban city types dominate the market in terms of demand.

We created a new dataframe containing the total rides, total drivers, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver for each city type. Based on our results we see that the total number of fares, drivers, and rides are much higher in urban city types than in the other city types. Rural cities unsurprisingly have the least amount of rides, drivers, and fares. This should remain true in most cities as urban areas have a higher population while rural areas will have less demand in general. However, as we move into the averages for fares per ride and fares per driver, we notice that areas with less population and demand have a higher price per ride/driver. While urban areas average out to around $24.5 and $16.5 per ride and driver respectively, we notice that in rural areas these numbers jump up to $34.6 and $55.4. This may be a result of there being less drivers in rural areas and therefore the inelastic demands in rural areas causes each fare to have a higher price.

We also performed a visual chart for fares by city type and noted that the trends across all city types are typically the same where we see a massive rise in fares around the end of Feburary before flattening out into the the spring months. The only significant difference is taht for Suburban cities, we notice a rise in demand at the end of April as we approach the summer months. This might be due to students that are see the beginning of their summer breaks and thus the increase in demand for rides.  However, generally the trends are the same through each city type. 


## Summary
Based on our results, our 3 recommendations for the CEO of Pyber are: 
  * We noticed that rural drivers are making more per ride than drivers in more populated areas. This might disincentivize drivers in suburban and urban areas where most of PyBer's revenes are generated. The CEO can either recruit more drivers in rural areas to meet the demands therefore driving the prices down or adjust the fare prices in populated areas to meet that of rural areas. 
  * Cost in rural areas are also higher, we recommend that since there are less demands in rural areas, adjusting the price to be lower could help further increase demand. 
  * A majority of the CEO's focus should be in the urban population as a overwhelming majority of the revenue is generated there.
